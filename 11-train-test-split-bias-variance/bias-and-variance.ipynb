    "Is the MSE for a fitted linear regression the same thing as the bias?\n",
    "- It's close, but bias does not apply to a specific fitted model. Bias is the expected error of a model no matter what subset of the data it is fit on. This way, if we happen to get a lucky MSE fitting a model on a particular subset of our data, this does not mean we will have a low bias overall."

You might train on the entire dataset as the very last step when a model is chosen, hoping to make the final model as accurate as possible. Or, you could use this to estimate the degree of overfitting.\n",

You could also use this as a final step after the model is finalized (often called evaluating the model against a **validation set**).\n",
    "3. **Cross-validation** is the gold standard for estimating accuracy and comparing accuracy across models.(i.e. do multiple train-test splits)\n",
